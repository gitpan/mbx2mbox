mbx2mbox

mbx2mbox converts Outlook mbxes into regular mailboxes readable by programs
like Pine, Eudora, and Netscape. It seems to work for the couple of mailboxes
I have. Your mileage may vary.

New in version 0.32:
- Improved parsing of emails (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)
- Header "From someone@somewhere.com" now uses sender's email address.
  (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)
- Quoted headers are no longer mistakenly processed.
  (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)

New in version 0.3:
- Improved parsing of emails at the expense of speed for mailboxes with large
  attachments. 
- Added -c flag for more aggressive removal of odd characters in email bodies.
  (Weakened default removal for more friendly handling of non-English
  characters.) Thanks to <joerg.hau(at)dplanet.ch>
- Added debugging mode (-d)

Send me email if you would like to be notified of updates.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) I have
a suite of tests that I can give you if you ask. Keep in mind that I'm likely
to turn down obscure features to avoid including everything but the kitchen
sink.
