mbx2mbox - convert mbx and dbx mailboxes to standard RFC822 mailboxes

mbx2mbox attempts to convert Microsoft's proprietary .mbx and .dbx format
mailboxes to the standard RFC822 mailboxes used by programs like Pine, Eudora,
and Netscape. It does not work for newer versions of Outlook and Outlook
Express.

New in Version 0.33:
- Restructured code
- The date on the "From" line is now correctly built from the "From:" line.
- mbx2mbox now uses Date::Manip to construct the date for the "From" line.
- Added tests
- Project moved to SourceForge (http://mbx2mbox@sourceforge.net/).

New in Version 0.32:
- Improved parsing of emails
- Generated header "From someone@somewhere.com" now uses sender's email
  address.
- Quoted headers are no longer mistakenly processed.
